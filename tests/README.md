If you're looking at this folder, you probably expect to see some well thought out test files which put the library and language through its paces in order to demonstrate what it's capable of and that it's in working order. 

You will not find that. This is a messy and barely-organized collection of old miscellanious test files I made briefly in order to debug things and get individual parts of luxture in working order. Some of them are not written for the current state of the code, and others will not work unless dragged elsewhere in specific combinations. 

Abandon all hope and sanity now if you hope to get anything out of this folder.
