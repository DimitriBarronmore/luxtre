# Luxtre

Luxtre is a small dialect of [Lua 5.2](http://www.lua.org/) which compiles back into native code, written entirely in native Lua. It adds a handful of helpful additions to the syntax and enables simple macro preprocessing.

Luxtre is compatible with Lua JIT, Lua 5.1, Lua 5.2, Lua 5.3, and Lua 5.4, but does not currently backport newer syntax. Existing Lua code will work in Luxtre without modification.

**Current Status:** 
Luxtre executes and outputs files properly, but is not yet complete. Future versions will have further syntax changes/additions and the ability to add new ones, as well as better error location redirection and better formatted output.

**How to Use:**

```lua
local luxtre = require "luxtre.loader"

-- Set up Luxtre to run .lux files through require
luxtre.register()
-- This will now load the file "foo.lux"
require("foo")

-- load/dofile equivalents for .lux files
local chunk = luxtre.loadfile("file")
luxtre.dofile("file")

-- load or execute strings of luxtre code
local chunk = luxtre.loadstring(code_string)
luxtre.dostring("return -> print('hello world')")

---[[ Syntax Changes ]]--
-- Table constructors can use colon-syntax.
local tab = {foo: 1, bar: 2, buzz: 3}
-- >> local tab = {foo = 1, bar = 2, buzz = 3}

-- Table constructors and string literals are automatically wrapped
-- in parentheses when treated like expressions.
{1, 2, 3}[1];  "string":rep(5)
-- >> ({1, 2, 3})[1];  ("string"):rep(5)


-- Augmented assignment: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, ^=
bar += 2 * 5 - funcall()
-- >> bar = bar + (2 * 5 - funcall())

-- Simple Iterator
-- Works as a standalone statement only.
i++
-- >> i = i + 1

-- Moonscript-style arrow lambdas
-- Usable as anonymous function constructors, or as a function declaration. 
-- Fat arrows (=>) insert a self parameter.
func (args) -> print(args)
-- >> func = function(args) print(args) end

-- Function decorators
@decorator
function somefunc(arguments, ...)
    print(whatever)
end
--[[ >>
	somefunc = decorator(
        function(arguments, ...)
            print(whatever)
        end )
--]]
```


## Preprocessing
Before the file is compiled, lines which begin with '#' are run in the preprocessor (ignoring trailing whitespace, shebangs, and multi-line strings/comments). The preprocessor executes these lines top-to-bottom as lua code.

The preprocessor is not yet complete, but in the current state it can be used to determine what is written to the final file as well as define macros.

### Conditional Lines

Within an unclosed preprocessor block (`do`, `if`, `while`, `repeat`, or `for`), input lines will only be written to the output dependent on the surrounding preprocessor code. 
For example:
```lua
# if hello then
    print("hello world")
# else
    print("goodbye world")
# end
-- Outputs one line or the other depending on the value of the variable 'hello'

print(
#local count = 0
#repeat
#   count = count + 1
    "the end is never " .. 
#until count == 10
"" )
-- The final result concatenates "the end is never" with itself ten times. 
```
### Macros
Macros can be defined as string keyed values in the `macros` table. There are three types of macro: simple, function-like, and callback.

Macros are always evaluated in the order they were originally added, regardless of whether they have since been changed. This means that macros are fully deterministic in how they interact with each other.
```lua
-- Simple macros are simply a string key and a result.
# macros.constant = "1000"
print(constant) --> 'print(1000)'

-- Wacky characters work as well.
# macros["ðŸ˜‚"] = ":joy:"
print("ðŸ˜‚") -- > 'print(":joy:")

-- Function-like macros have pathethesised arguments in the key.
# macros["reverse(arg1, arg2)"] = "arg2 arg1"
print("reverse(world, hello)") --> 'print("hello world")'

-- Function-like macros support '...' as a catchall last argument.
-- The arguments collected are separated by a comma and a space, for use in function calls.
# macros["discardfirst(first, ...)"] = "..."
print(discardfirst(1,2,3)) --> 'print(2, 3)'

-- Callback macros are executed entirely in the preprocessor.
-- Any variable names passed will evaluate to preprocessor values.
-- The return value of the function is cast to a string and replaces the original text.
# example_msg = "hi there"
# macros.print_var = function(name)
#   return name
# end
print( "print_var(example_msg)" ) --> 'print( "hi there" )'

-- All macros will delete themselves from the input if they return a blank string.
# macros["<blank>"] = ""
print(<blank>) --> 'print()'

-- This can be useful when combined with conditional logic.
# if debug == "true" then
#   macros["log(...)"] = "print(...)"
# else
#   macros["log(...)"] = ""

-- Simple and Function-Like macros can be defined more easily with #define syntax.
-- #define <name>[parens] <result>
# define fizzbuzz "1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz"
# define add_bark(arg) barkargbark
# define blank

print(fizzbuzz)         --> 'print("1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz")'
print("add_bark(woof)") --> 'print("barkwoofbark")'
print(blank)            --> 'print()'
```

# Command-line Use
Lux currently offers an extremely basic method for running files directly from a commandline in linux. Add the `bin` folder to your path, and call `lux <filename>` to run a .lux file. 

Note that it expects the `bin` folder to be adjacent to the `luxtre` folder; you cannot move it to a separate location.
